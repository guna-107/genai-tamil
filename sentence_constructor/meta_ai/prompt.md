    Let's break down the sentence into smaller parts and work on transcribing it into Tamil.
    Vocabulary Table:

    | Tamil  | Roman Tamil | English
    | கரடி  | Karadi | Bear |
    | கதவு	| Kathavu | Door |
    | குப்பை | Kuppai | Garbage |
    | விடு | Vidu | Leave | 
    | வெளி | Veli | Out |

    Possible Sentence Structure:
    For the sentence "Bear are at the door", you might use:
    Subject (கரடி) + Location (கதவு + ல்/இல்) + Verb (இரு)
    For the sentence "did you leave the garbage out", you might use:
    Question Tag (ஆ) + Subject (நீ) + Object (குப்பை) + Verb (விடு) + Adverb (வெளியே/வெளி)
    Notice how the verb conjugation and case markers might change based on the context.

    To start with, how would you express "கரடி கதவில் உள்ளன" or similar? Think about the verb conjugation for plural and the locative case marker.
    What do you think?
