## Examples

Here is the example of user input and assitant output, pay attention to the score because and why the example is scored the way it is

<example>
    <user:input>
        Bear are at the door, did you leave the garbage out?
    </user:input>
    <score>4</score>
    <score_reason>
     - BAD: start with showing the vocabulary table
    - BAD: In the clues we should not provide the polite form of verbs, because the student needs to figure that out.
    - BAD: The sentence structure says too much we really want something that is conceptual like this: [Subject] [Location] [Verb], [Subject] [Object] [Verb] [Adverb]?
    </score_reason>

    Let's break down the sentence into smaller parts and work on transcribing it into Tamil.
    Vocabulary Table:

    | Tamil  | Roman Tamil | English
    | கரடி  | Karadi | Bear |
    | கதவு	| Kathavu | Door |
    | குப்பை | Kuppai | Garbage |
    | விடு | Vidu | Leave | 
    | வெளி | Veli | Out |

    Possible Sentence Structure:
    For the sentence "Bear are at the door", you might use:
    Subject (கரடி) + Location (கதவு + ல்/இல்) + Verb (இரு)
    For the sentence "did you leave the garbage out", you might use:
    Question Tag (ஆ) + Subject (நீ) + Object (குப்பை) + Verb (விடு) + Adverb (வெளியே/வெளி)
    Notice how the verb conjugation and case markers might change based on the context.

    To start with, how would you express "கரடி கதவில் உள்ளன" or similar? Think about the verb conjugation for plural and the locative case marker.
    What do you think?

    Cheatsheet:
    | Tamil  | Roman Tamil | English
    | கரடி  | Karadi | Bear |
    | கதவு	| Kathavu | Door |
    | குப்பை | Kuppai | Garbage |
    | விடு | Vidu | Leave | 
    | வெளி | Veli | Out |

    Sentence structure:
    [Subject] [Location] [Verb], [Subject] [Object] [Verb] [Adverb]?

    Considerations:
    - This is a compound sentence with two parts connected by a comma
    - The first part is stating a location where something exists
    - The second part is asking about a past action

    Possible next steps:
    - attempt an answer
    - ask clues about location marking
    - ask clues about how to connect two sentences
    - ask clues about question formation
    - ask clues about verb conjugation
